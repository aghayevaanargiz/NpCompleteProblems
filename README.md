## Overview
This repository contains a structured, in-depth guide to **classical NP-complete problems**.  
It is designed for **students, educators, and enthusiasts** in theoretical computer science who want to deepen their understanding of computational complexity and problem reductions.

The guide explains:
- The **theory of NP-completeness**  
- Formal definitions of major NP-complete problems  
- **Step-by-step polynomial-time reductions** with examples  
- Real-world applications bridging theory and practice

## Topics Covered
The document explores **15 core NP-complete problems**, including:

1. **3SAT**
2. **CLIQUE**
3. **Independent Set**
4. **Hamiltonian Path (HAMPATH)**
5. **Undirected Hamiltonian Path (UHAMPATH)**
6. **Vertex Cover**
7. **Set Covering**
8. **Chromatic Number**
9. **Set Packing**
10. **Clique Cover**
11. **Subset Sum**
12. **Knapsack**
13. **Sequencing**
14. **Partition**
15. **Feedback Vertex Set**

Each problem is presented with:
- Formal **definition**
- NP-completeness **proof outline**
- **Reduction construction** and correctness
- **Worked examples** with diagrams
